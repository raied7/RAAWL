# RAAWL
Resize And Add Watermark/Logo - Python program for Pitt CSC Hacks 2020

This is my submission for Pitt CSC Hacks 2020.

My project is called RAAWL (Resize and Add Watermark/Logo), and its a python program that allows you to add a logo/watermark of your choice to your images. The details are explained in the video. 

The advantage of this program over regular photo editing software is that it is less tedious, meaning you do not have to open up every image individually: you can simply input its name or you can choose to add the logo/watermark to every image in the folder which only takes a few seconds!

The drawbacks are that you either have to guess or calculate the dimensions of the logo so it will look correct on the images. I was looking into an algorithm/function that would calculate the best fit dimensions for the logo, but I did not make a lot of progress with that. Maybe I will add it later if I am able to figure it out!

One of the things I did not mention was that this is essentially my first time coding in Python and I was able to learn a lot of the fundamentals/basics with this project! Although frustrating at times, it was an overall fun experience and I am looking forward to next year's event already!
